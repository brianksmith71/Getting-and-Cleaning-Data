## Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
### Course project for March 2 cohort

This README pertains to coursework for the Coursera "Getting and Cleaning Data" course proctored by Johns Hopkins University.

**The dataset related hereto that should be found in this repository includes the following files:**

    * 'README.md':  This file.
    * 'run_analysis.R':  The R script file to produce the requested tidy data set.
    * 'tidydata.txt':  The output of the above-mentioned script.
    * 'codebook.md':  The code book describing the variables and transformations involved in this assignment.
    
**Notes:**

    * I kept the script as concise as possible while hopefully preserving readability.
    * The tidydata.txt file is comma-separated in case you desired to import it for scrutiny.
    * I hope I've made this assignment straight-forward for peer review.
